# RAG Project

## Overview

This repository contains a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) implementation that enhances large language model outputs with relevant knowledge from a vector database. By combining the generative capabilities of LLMs with information retrieval, this system provides more accurate, up-to-date, and contextually relevant responses.

## Features

- Document ingestion and chunking pipeline
- Vector embeddings generation and storage
- Semantic search functionality
- Context-aware response generation
- Simple API interface

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.10+
- pip (Python package manager)
- Virtual environment tool (optional but recommended)
